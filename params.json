There are lots of application helping and contributing towards it. We would like to add more to it. Today if you want to travel through public transport, you always have this tension whether you missed your bus or not, so you will always leave your home early so that you can catch the first bus to your destination. What if you missed the bus, you will get irritated and angry. We know the bus will never be on time and people suffer because of it.

Where is your bus? 2. How much time will it take to reach to your bus stop, etc It will save a lot of time and people can use bus service more efficiently.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n##### Cloning the project\r\n`git clone https://github.com/sudheeshshetty/Bustracker.git`\r\n\r\n##### Database - Mongo\r\n* Start mongodb `mongod --dbpath=\"/Bustracker/data/\"`\r\n* Add the data.
